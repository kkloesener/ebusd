===================

ebusd is a daemon for handling communication with eBUS devices connected to a
2-wire bus system ("energy bus" used by numerous heating systems).

Features
--------

The main features of the daemon are:

 * use USB serial, TCP connected, or UDP device
 * actively send messages to and receive answers from the eBUS
 * passively listen to messages sent on the eBUS
 * regularly poll for messages
 * cache all messages
 * scan for bus participants
 * parse messages to human readable values by using CSV message configuration files
 * automatically pick CSV message configuration files by scan result
 * grab all messages on the eBUS and provide decoding hints
 * log messages and problems to a log file
 * capture sent/received bytes to a log file as text
 * dump received bytes to binary files for later playback/analysis
 * listen for client connections on a dedicated TCP port (command line style and/or HTTP)
 * optionally format messages and data in JSON on dedicated HTTP port
 * optionally publish received message data to MQTT topics and vice versa (if authorized)
 * optional ACL and required user authentication for access to certain messages


Installation
------------

Either pick the [latest release package](https://github.com/john30/ebusd/releases/latest)
suitable for your system or build it yourself.

Building ebusd from the source requires the following packages and/or features:
 * autoconf (>=2.63) + automake (>=1.11) or cmake
 * g++ with C++11 support (>=4.8.1)
 * make
 * kernel with pselect or ppoll support
 * glibc with argp support or argp-standalone
 * libmosquitto-dev for MQTT support

To start the build process, run these commands:  
> ./autogen.sh  
> make install  


Documentation

Configuration
-------------

The most important part of each ebusd installation is the message
configuration. By default, only rudimentary messages are interpreted.
Check the Wiki and/or the configuration repository:

Docker image
------------

A Docker image is available on the hub and it contains the latest German configuration files.
You can use it like this:  
> docker pull john30/ebusd  
> docker run -it --rm --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -p 8888 john30/ebusd
